    <blockquote>I love anything tech and have spent my whole life "hacking" in the real sense of the world - tinkering with things (normally in a shed).</blockquote>
    <p class="first">When I got my first Amiga aged 9 it started my lifelong passion for computing. I spent hours playing around in Workbench, changing colours, icons and wallpapers. I started with simple Basic scripts, but before long I was writing my own games and demos. My passion for computing had been ignited, and it has continued to this day. Over 30 years later I still enjoy configuring computers and making them work for me!</p>
